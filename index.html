      <h4>About</h4>

      <img class="inner-img" src="images/image.jpg" alt="Rosalind Franklin">

      <p class="text_blocks"> British chemist Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born into an affluent and influential Jewish family on July 25, 1920, in Notting Hill, London, England. She displayed exceptional intelligence from early childhood, knowing from the age of 15 that she wanted to be a scientist. She received her education at several schools, including North London Collegiate School, where she excelled in science, among other things.</p>
      <p class="text_blocks">Rosalind Franklin enrolled at Newnham College, Cambridge, in
        1938 and studied chemistry. In 1941, she was awarded Second Class Honors
        in her finals, which, at that time, was accepted as a bachelor's degree in
        the qualifications for employment. She went on to work as an assistant
        research officer at the British Coal Utilisation Research Association, where
        she studied the porosity of coalâ€”work that was the basis of her 1945 Ph.D.
        thesis "The physical chemistry of solid organic colloids with special reference
        to coal."</p>

      <h4>Scientific Discovery</h4>

      <img class="inner-img" src="images/x-ray.jpg">

      <p class="text_blocks">
        In January 1951, Franklin began working as a research associate at the
        King's College London in the biophysics unit, where director John Randall
        used her expertise and X-ray diffraction techniques (mostly of proteins
        and lipids in solution) on DNA fibers. Studying DNA structure with X-ray
        diffraction, Franklin and her student Raymond Gosling made an amazing
        discovery: They took pictures of DNA and discovered that there were
        two forms of it, a dry "A" form and a wet "B" form. One of their X-ray
        diffraction pictures of the "B" form of DNA, known as Photograph 51,
        became famous as critical evidence in identifying the structure of DNA.
        The photo was acquired through 100 hours of X-ray exposure from a machine
        Franklin herself had refined.

      <h4>Controversy</h4>

      <p class="text_blocks">
        Despite her cautious and diligent work ethic, Franklin had a personality conflict with colleague Maurice Wilkins, one that would end up costing her greatly. In January 1953, Wilkins changed the course of DNA history by disclosing without Franklin's permission or knowledge her Photo 51 to competing scientist James Watson, who was working on his own DNA model with Francis Crick at Cambridge.
      </p>
      <p class="text_blocks">The two scientists did in fact use what they saw in Photo 51 as the basis for their famous model of DNA, which they published on March 7, 1953, and for which they received a Nobel Prize in 1962. Crick and Watson were also able to take most of the credit for the finding: When publishing their model in Nature magazine in April 1953, they included a footnote acknowledging that they were "stimulated by a general knowledge" of Franklin's and Wilkins' unpublished contribution, when in fact, much of their work was rooted in Franklin's photo and findings. Randall and the Cambridge laboratory director came to an agreement, and both Wilkins' and Franklin's articles were published second and third in the same issue of Nature. Still, it appeared that their articles were merely supporting Crick and Watson's.</p>
